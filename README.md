# spam_classification
SVM based spam email classifier, written in MATLAB

In this project, a practical spam classifier was built with support vector machine (SVM). For a typical email, we first conduct preprocessing and map the content into a critical feature space. Then the training and cross-validating of support vector machine is performed. 

In this project, 4000 training samples and 500 testing samples are introduced. We collate three kinds of kernel function (Gaussian, Polynomial, and Linear) accordingly, and explore best parameter for each function, i.e. order of polynomial and variance of gaussian function. We find that, for this spam classification problem, linear kernel has best performance since the feature space is exactly high-dimensional. Besides, we change the penalty parameter exponentially and find reasonable values. Finally, we build another classifier with NaiÌˆve Bayes Model. Result shows that the SVM has better performance in this case.

## main.m
To start the project, just type 

```
main
```
in MATLAB console.

The program will automatically train and cross-validate the SVM and Naive Bayes models based on the training set and cross validation set.

The user can also test their own emails. To do that, please copy & paste the content of the email into `Testing_Email.txt`.

## Example
Here is a typical example output:

```

First the user has to specify the kernel function of SVM, then the program indicates the cross-validation accuracy for SVM and Bayes model.

```
Please Choose The Kernel Function for SVM: 
1. Gaussian
2. Linear
3. Polynomial
3
Training Naive Bayes... 
Cross Validation Accuracy: 96.600000

Training SVM...
Use Polynomial Kernel
Cross Validation Accuracy: 81.800000
```

As we can see, the Naive Bayes is better than polynomial SVM in this case. If users want change the kernal function, we can just change the input to 1/2 at the very begining.

Then the program gives us the top 10 spam words:

```
Top 10 predictors of spam:

 un         (0.014508) 
 will       (0.014031) 
```

After that, the program will process the user's email with NLP pipeline - to lower case, stemming, handle URL and numbers, etc. This process will map the email content into a 1899-dimensional feature space, so we can apply our SVM and Bayes models.

```

In the example, the content had been text-processed so they can find corresponding Indices in the wordlist. `Word Indices` shows the position where the 1899-dimensional vector will have elements equal to 1, all other elements will equal to 0.

Spam Classification by SVM: 0

Spam Classification by Naive Bayes: 1
```

Finally, our two classifier give us two different prediction: the SVM thinks this email is not a spam while the Naive Bayes doesn't. Since the cross-validation results told us the Naive Bayes is more reliable, we will label this email as spam.
